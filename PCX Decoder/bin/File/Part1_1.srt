1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,800
Active Inspection Platform for Abnormal Road area

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,000
is an open platform to integrate satellite

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,200
and UAV data to innovate the road inspection process. 

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,100
By collecting satellite information,

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,700
the platform use unsupervised learning to

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,900
predict the hidden dangerous areas.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,600
Then, the UAV combines the AI module to achieves road inspection.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,300
This platform can improve the disaster response

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,900
and road maintenance for the public agency,

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,600
and reduce the  cost of road maintenance even in remote area.
